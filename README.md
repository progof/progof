## Hi, I'm Oleh ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’» Full-Stack Developer â€“ I design and build modern web applications with a focus on clean architecture, scalability, and user experience. I'm comfortable working across the entire stack, from backend APIs to interactive frontends.

ðŸš€ Currently building [AltLoc](https://altloc.com) â€“ a gamified habit-tracking platform inspired by Atomic Habits. I'm rewriting the app using Java Spring Boot on the backend and Nuxt 3 (Vue) on the frontend.

ðŸŽ“ Studying Computer Science at [WSZiB KrakÃ³w](https://www.wszib.edu.pl/), where I combine academic knowledge with practical development.

ðŸ“š I maintain a [university projects repository](https://github.com/progof/university) featuring assignments, experiments, and mini-projects in various technologies like Java, C++, SQL, and more.

ðŸ“ˆ Here's how I spend my time coding:
